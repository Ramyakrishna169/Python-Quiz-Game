How It Works
  Game Start: When the program runs, it greets the user with a welcome message.
  User Input: The user is asked if they want to play by entering "yes" or "no." If the user enters anything other than "yes," the game ends.
Quiz Questions:
  The quiz consists of four questions that test the user on basic computer terms:
    1)CPU (Central Processing Unit)
    2)GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
    3)RAM (Random Access Memory)
    4)PSU (Power Supply Unit)
For each question, the user is prompted to input an answer.
If the answer is correct, the score increases by one.
Score Calculation: At the end of the game,
the program displays the total number of correct answers and calculates the percentage score based on the total questions.
